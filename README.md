# hello-world

This repository contains a simple login page styled to resemble modern biotech UI patterns.

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the signâ€‘in form, which links to account creation and password recovery pages.
All page styles live in `style.css` so you can customize colors, fonts and layout without touching the HTML.

The latest design refresh introduces a sleek gradient background with a gentle dancing animation, an animated login box, the Poppins font, and a simple logo at the top of the form for a more polished look.
